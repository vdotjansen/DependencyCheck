Configuration
====================
The dependency-check-update task downloads and updates the local copy of the NVD.
There are several reasons that one may want to use this task; primarily, creating
an update that will be run only once a day or once every few days (but not greater
than 7 days) and then use the `autoUpdate="false"` setting on individual
dependency-check scans. See [Internet Access Required](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/data/index.html)
for more information on why this task would be used.

```xml
<target name="dependency-check-update" description="Dependency-Check Update">
    <dependency-check-update />
</target>
```
